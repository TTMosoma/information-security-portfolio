# information-security-portfolio
## What is this repository is?
This repository contains my track record in software security engineering. This repository is a timeline of my commitment to software security and insight into my growth in this field.

## Who am I?
My name is Terry Mosoma, I am a security-first software engineer with over a decade of experience, in insurance and banking industry. Using this field experience, I am now enhancing this experience with a security first mindset and pro security software development whist enhancing end user experience.

## Who this repository for?
I am using repository to share my journey through software security as a senior .NET developer.
This repo contains artefacts created by myself, used as a data archive as I work my way through new concepts or strengthen my existing knowledge.

This repository will also be used as a reference for my work and commitment to the world of software security engineering. 

I strive to learn constantly, my commitment to this repository is to have weekly scenarios that showcase a new concept and how I would resolve it. 

Using my coding background, these scenarios will largely be exploits I have come across in my career, some I have thought about or read about or thought experiments.  I may present these exploits as examples, then explore how I would respond to these them as a senior security engineer, using my coding I will resolve these using coding and typical production environment setbacks. 
Each article of work will have a related blog item where I detail the resolution, each blog will have a consistent flow and structure.

## Why did I create this repository?
As an experienced .NET/.NET Core Developer, I seek to enhance my capabilities, improve my knowledge base while keeping track of my work and artefacts.

This repository outlines information about security concepts, and potential threats and how I would resolve these threats in a production environment.

Throughout all my entries, I put myself as a senior security engineer. As such, this repository gives a window of what I would do in a variety of security scenario, given constraints of a production environment, such as limited resolution time, limited capacity to test various resolutions and little to no downtime expectations

## What are my long-term goals?
I strive to be a dependable information security engineer, a future security leader and go to person for information security engineering and concepts.

From a young age, I fell in love with app development that was my introduction to software development, it follows that my growth into software security should be in application security.  As with my software development journey, my security journey will quickly grow and improve into other fields such as system architecture security and network security. I will document every technology I choose to learn about on this repository.
